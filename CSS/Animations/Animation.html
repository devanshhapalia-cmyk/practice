    <h1>Animations</h1>
    <!-- CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript -->
    <!-- The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation. -->
    <!-- The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run. -->

    <!-- The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate
    cycles.

    The animation-direction property can have the following values:

    normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default
    reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)
    alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
    alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards -->
    <div class="animationDiv"></div>

    <div class="animationProperty"></div>

    <!-- instead of writing long code like:
    div {
    animation-name: myAnimation;
    animation-duration: 5s;
    animation-timing-function: linear;
    animation-delay: 2s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-direction: alternate;
    }

    use only:
    div {
    animation: myAnimation 5s linear 2s infinite alternate;---name duration timing-function iteration-delay direction;
    } -->
