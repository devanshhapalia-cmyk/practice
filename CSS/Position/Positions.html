    <h1>Positioning in CSS:</h1>
    <!-- CSS positioning allows you to control the layout and placement of HTML elements on a web page. 
     There are several positioning methods available in CSS: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky. -->
<br><br>
     1. Static Positioning (default):
     <!-- Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document. -->
     <div class="staticPositioning">This div uses static positioning (default).</div>   
<br><br>
        2. Relative Positioning:
        <!-- Elements are positioned relative to their normal position. -->
        <div class="relativePositioning">This div uses relative positioning and is moved 20px down and 30px right from its normal position.</div>
<br><br>
        3. Absolute Positioning:
        <!-- Elements are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position other than static). 
         If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the
            viewport). -->  
        <div class="absolutePositioningContainer">
            <div class="absolutePositioning">This div uses absolute positioning and is placed 50px from the top and 100px from the left of its nearest positioned ancestor.</div>
        </div>
<br><br>
        4. Fixed Positioning:
        <!-- Elements are positioned relative to the viewport, which means they stay in the same place even when the page is scrolled. -->
        <div class="fixedPositioning">This div uses fixed positioning and stays in the same place when you scroll.</div>    
<br><br>
        5. Sticky Positioning:
        <!-- Elements are treated as relative positioned until they cross a specified threshold, at which point they    
            are treated as fixed positioned. -->    
        <div class="stickyPositioning">This div uses sticky positioning. Scroll down to see the effect.</div>
        <div style="height: 1500px;"></div> <!-- Just to enable scrolling -->
