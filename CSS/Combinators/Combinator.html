    <h1>Combinator</h1>
    <!-- CSS combinators are used to define the relationship between selectors.
    There are four main types of combinators in CSS:
    1. Descendant Combinator (space): Selects elements that are descendants of a specified element.
    2. Child Combinator (>): Selects elements that are direct children of a specified element.
    3. Adjacent Sibling Combinator (+): Selects elements that are the next sibling of a specified element.
    4. General/Subsequent Sibling Combinator (~): Selects all siblings of a specified element that follow it. -->

    <h2>
        1. Descendant Combinator Example:
    </h2>
    <div class="ancestor">
        <p>This is a paragraph inside a div with class "ancestor".</p>
        <span>This is a span inside the same div.</span>
        <div>
              <p>This is a paragraph inside a div with class "ancestor".</p>
        </div>
        <p>This is a paragraph inside a div with class "ancestor".</p>
    </div>
    <p>This is p outside Class.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>
        2. Child Combinator Example:
    </h2>
    <div class="parent">
        <p>This is a direct child paragraph of div with class "parent".</p>
        <span>
            <p>This paragraph is NOT a direct child (it's a grandchild).</p>
        </span>
        <p>This is a direct child paragraph of div with class "parent".</p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <h2>
        3. Adjacent/Next Sibling Combinator Example:
    </h2>
    <div class="nextSibling">
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <p>This paragraph is an adjacent sibling of the h3 element.</p>
        <p>This paragraph is NOT an adjacent sibling (it's a following sibling).</p>
    </div>
    <p>This paragraph is an adjacent sibling of the h3 element.</p>
    <p>This paragraph is an adjacent sibling of the h3 element.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>
        4. General/Subsequent Sibling Combinator Example:
    </h2>
    <div class="subsequentSibling">
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <p>This paragraph is a general sibling of the h3 element.</p>
        <p>This paragraph is also a general sibling of the h3 element.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This paragraph is a general sibling of the h3 element.</p>
    <p>This paragraph is a general sibling of the h3 element.</p>
